From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Data communication, including data transmission and data reception, is the transfer of data, transmitted and received over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel.
Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication using radio spectrum, storage media and computer buses.
The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.

Analog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable.
The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method.
The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation is carried out by modem equipment.
